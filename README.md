LibSoundCloud-iOS
=================

A custom library for using soundcloud in your iOS apps. This library doesn't have any dependancy projects like the official SoundCloud SDK and should be much easier to implement in your projects

The standard iOS library from SoundCloud is quite heavy with many dependancies and has not been updated for quite a while.
This project delivers an almost directly ready to use implementation of the SoundCloud API.

Still WIP but already has the following functionality:

Login with OAUTH via Safari browser with SoundCloud, Google or Facebook account
- Search for tracks
- Get private user tracks
- Download and play selected tracks.
